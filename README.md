# Twitter Clone (nextjs,expressjs, typescript, grapghql, redis, )

(https://sushil-twitter-clone-client.vercel.app)[https://sushil-twitter-clone-client.vercel.app]

This project is a full-stack web application built using Node.js and Next.js. It utilizes a GraphQL server running in a Node.js environment for the backend, with Prisma ORM for interacting with a PostgreSQL database. The database is hosted and managed using Supabase, a cloud PostgreSQL service. Redis is used for query caching on the server side, which helps to increase query speeds.

The project also incorporates various authentication and authorization features. Google OAuth is used for Sign in with Google functionality, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication.

On the frontend, Next.js is used as the framework for building React applications. It provides server-side rendering and optimized performance. TailwindCSS is used for styling and creating reusable components. Typescript is used throughout the project to maintain code quality and write type-safe code.

The project makes use of several additional tools and technologies. Codegen is used for generating typesafe GraphQL queries and mutations. Graphql-Request is used as the API client for client-server communication. React-Query is used for client-side data caching and query caching. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is used for storage, deployments, and CDN (Content Delivery Network).
